									<h2>Portfolio</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have been a fivem plugin developer for 4 years now. During my journey I have worked with a lot of 
									projects well known by the polish community. You can expect here a lot of diversity in terms of 
									different project assumptions from project managers. Projects I have participated in, succeeded in 
									active player counts every time reaching the maximum capacity of a server. I can bravely say, that 
									no matter the requirements, the goal of my client is always achieveable with enough cooperation and 
									patience. In terms of payments and prices, it depends on the difficulty of client's needs, so if you 
									are interested in I advise you to hop on to other sections.

									<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
								</header>
								<h2 style="font-size: 150%;">
									What is the pricing?
								</h2>
								<p>
									As I said in the portfolio section, the pricing is dependent on the client's needs and
									its difficulty. If you would like to pursue your project additionally with my help you
									should acknowledge that long time cooperation benefits in understanding each other better 
									and both needs. Whether you are "just curious" of the developers prices do not waste both
									mine and your time.
								</p>
								<h2 style="font-size: 150%;">
									What can be expected from my work?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Since polish fivem community mostly adores roleplay servers in this modification, then all 
									of my works circulate around it. From coding from scratch various original job plugins to
									setting up custom models of building insides and appartments. My work may be divided into
									two sections: selling already done plugin packages or coding new from scratch. Of course
									if it is required I can also fulfill the role of setting up the server and mySQL for additional
									charges.
								</p>
								<h2 style="font-size: 150%;">
									What payments do you accept?
								</h2>
								<p>
									Only paypal, no paysafecards or crypto.
								</p>
								<h2 style="font-size: 150%;">
									What is the order of paying and receiving the plugin package?
								</h2>
								<p>
									After concluding the client's needs and price negotiations, the deadline of finishing the work 
									is given. Halfway in work the client is mentioned of the progress and upon that, half of previously 
									initiated price is required to be paid and upon receiving the money the work is continued. The other half
									is paid upon finishing the project before sending the files.
